artist page:

automaticly create artist route for every UID from an artist

make clicking on an artist on the mainpage redirect them to that specific route.

get necessery data from the spotify API.

fill page with the data the API provides. (Name, top songs (with cover image), maybe discograpy section  )

implement the sraper API for the content that is missing atm: (artist discription, banner).
